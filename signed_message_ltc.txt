Subject: Deprecation of LibreNode Litecoin Services

Hello LibreNode users,

Following the earlier deprecation of our Bitcoin services, I've decided to also deprecate our Litecoin services. This decision comes after careful consideration of multiple factors:
 - Electrum-LTC has not received meaningful updates in over three years.
 - Maintaining a Fulcrum Electrum server for an unmaintained Electrum fork introduces unnecessary resource strain, especially given the recent wave of attacks targeting Electrum servers.
 - The reliance on older, less secure protocols introduces a potential operational security (opsec) risk that is not justifiable.

In my opinion, transparent blockchains such as Bitcoin and Litecoin offer only pseudonymity, not privacy. In an increasingly surveilled digital world, this no longer meets the gold standard for user protection.

As a result, I will be shifting focus toward enhancing our Monero services on LibreNode to increase decentralization, privacy, and ease of access for users seeking true digital privacy.

At this time, no other LibreNode services are slated for deprecation. This decision was made specifically to reduce attack surface and uphold the privacy standards that LibreNode was founded on.

Sincerely,
Tech1k
